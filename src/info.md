# BrickGame Tetris

Welcome to BrickGame Tetris! This is a classic implementation of the Tetris game developed in C using the `ncurses` library for the terminal interface. Below are the instructions on how to play the game.

## How to Play

### Directions

- **Start New Game:** Press `Enter`
- **End the Game:** Press `Q`
- **Pause the Game:** Press `Space`
- **Move Left:** Press the `Left Arrow`
- **Move Right:** Press the `Right Arrow`
- **Accelerate (Move Down Quickly):** Press the `Down Arrow`
- **Rotate the Piece:** Press `R`
- **Quit the Game:** Press `ESC`


### Scoring

- Clearing 1 row: 100 points
- Clearing 2 rows: 300 points
- Clearing 3 rows: 700 points
- Clearing 4 rows (Tetris): 1500 points

### Levels

- The game starts at level 1.
- Every time you score 600 points, the level increases by 1, and the speed of the falling pieces increases.
- The maximum level is 10.

### End of the Game

The game ends when a new piece cannot be placed at the top of the playing field, meaning the blocks have stacked too high. Your final score will be displayed, and if itâ€™s higher than your previous best, it will be saved as the new high score.

### Tips

- **Plan ahead:** Keep an eye on the next piece that will appear and plan where to place it.
- **Leave room:** Try to leave open spaces for the long straight piece (I-shaped tetromino) to clear multiple lines at once.
- **Stay calm:** As the game speeds up, stay calm and make quick decisions to avoid stacking blocks too high.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!
